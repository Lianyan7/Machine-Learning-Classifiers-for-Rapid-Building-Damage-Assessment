# A Machine Learning-Supported Rapid Classification of Building Damage Following the 2010–2011 Canterbury Earthquakes
Supplemental Materials for the Paper ***"A Machine Learning-Supported Rapid Classification of Building Damage Following the 2010–2011 Canterbury Earthquakes"***

This project evaluated the four machine learning classifiers—**Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)**—to predict building damage placards in New Zealand. The code was developed by Lianyan Li and is based on the methodologies described in the following publication:

This research was conducted with ethics approval granted by the University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics Committee (Reference Number 25474). The data utilised in this research contains sensitive building property information and is therefore confidential. However, a subset of the non-confidential data can be made available upon request. The Python file, ML Classifiers.py, includes the implementation of the four classifiers for training and testing each model, followed by the generation of a confusion matrix visualisation.

This repository is intended for academic and professional use and contributes to the advancement of rapid post-disaster damage assessment methodologies.
