# A Machine Learning-Supported Rapid Classification of Building Damage Following the 2010–2011 Canterbury Earthquakes
Supplemental Materials for the Paper "A Machine Learning-Supported Rapid Classification of Building Damage Following the 2010–2011 Canterbury Earthquakes"

This project evaluated the four machine learning classifiers—Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)—to predict building damage placards in New Zealand. The code was developed by Lianyan Li and is based on the methodologies described in the following publication:

Li, L., Chang-Richards, A., et al. (2025). A machine learning-supported rapid classification of building damage following the 2010–2011 Canterbury earthquakes. Engineering Structures.

To run the script, three documents are needed. Two of these are empirical datasets from the 2010–2011 Canterbury earthquake sequence (CES): DEE.xlsx and RBA.xlsx. The third document is the Python file, ML Classifiers.py, which includes the implementation of the four classifiers for training and testing each model, followed by the generation of a confusion matrix visualisation.

This repository is intended for academic and professional use and contributes to the advancement of rapid post-disaster damage assessment methodologies.
